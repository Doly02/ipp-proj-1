First project for the course Principles of programming languages and OO programming

### Introduction
The project is focused on processing the .IPPcode24 instructions and then generating an output file in .xml format, which serves as an input to the interpreter (see second project for the IPP course). 

A more detailed description of the project solution can be found in the documentation file located in the docs folder
